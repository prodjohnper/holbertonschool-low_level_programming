## Description

This is my submission project for *Holberton Coding School's* module of *Search Algorithms*. In this module I learned what is a search algorithm, what is a linear search, what us a binary search and what is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs.

## Files

- `README.md` - File that contains project description.
- `search_algos.h` - Header file containing function prototypes.
- `0-linear.c` - File containing the _printf function, which produces an output according to a format.
- `1-binary.c` - File with function that prints *character* cases.

### Big O Notation Files

- `2-O`
- `3-O`
